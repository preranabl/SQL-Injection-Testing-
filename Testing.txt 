 1. Manual Testing
Identify Input Fields: Test all user inputs (e.g., login forms, search bars).

Inject Malicious Inputs:

- Example: ' OR '1'='1 in the username field.
- Enter anything into the password field (e.g., yourpassword).
- Submit the form.

Expected Behavior:

If the application is vulnerable, the query will look like this:

   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'test'

The condition '1'='1' is always true, so the database will return all rows, and the application will log you in without valid credentials.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- If the application logs you in without valid credentials or displays unexpected data (e.g., database records), it is vulnerable to SQL injection.

- If the application rejects the input or shows an error, it may have some protections in place.
